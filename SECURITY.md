## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, use GitHub's private security advisory feature:

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/hamed-elfayome/Codex-Usage-Tracker/security/advisories)
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

### What to Include

To help us assess and address the issue quickly, please include:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., credential exposure, code injection, privilege escalation)
- **Step-by-step reproduction** instructions
- **Affected versions** (if known)
- **Potential impact** assessment
- **Proof of concept** code (if applicable)
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24-48 hours
- **Initial assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution timeline**: Depends on severity and complexity

We'll keep you informed throughout the process and credit you in the security advisory and release notes (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## Security Considerations

### Session Key Storage

- Session keys are stored locally in `~/.codex-session-key`
- File permissions are automatically set to `0600` (owner read/write only)
- Keys are never transmitted except to `codex.ai` via HTTPS
- No cloud sync or external storage

### Application Signing

- The app is currently **unsigned** (no Apple Developer certificate)
- macOS Gatekeeper will block the app on first launch
- Users must manually approve via System Settings → Privacy & Security
- **This is expected behavior** for community open-source apps

### Network Security

- All communication uses **HTTPS only**
- API requests are sent exclusively to `codex.ai` endpoints
- No telemetry, analytics, or third-party tracking
- Session authentication via secure cookies only

### Code Execution

- Codex Code integration scripts are installed to `~/.codex/`
- Script permissions are set to `755` (read/execute for all, write for owner)
- Scripts only read the existing session key file
- No arbitrary code execution from external sources

### Sandboxing

- App Sandbox is **disabled** to allow file system access
- Required for reading `~/.codex-session-key` and writing `~/.codex/` scripts
- Necessary trade-off for the app's core functionality

## Best Practices for Users

### Protect Your Session Key

- Never share your session key publicly
- Treat it like a password
- Rotate it if you suspect compromise (extract a fresh key from codex.ai)
- Check file permissions: `ls -la ~/.codex-session-key` should show `-rw-------`

### Verify Downloads

- Download only from official sources:
  - [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hamed-elfayome/Codex-Usage-Tracker/releases)
  - [Homebrew Tap](https://github.com/ggfevans/homebrew-codex-usage-tracker)
- Build from source if you prefer: `git clone` + Xcode build

### Keep Updated

- Security patches are released for the latest version only
- Enable notifications for new releases on GitHub
- Review the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for security-related updates

## Security Acknowledgments

We recognize and appreciate security researchers who help keep our community safe. Contributors who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be:

- Credited in the security advisory (with permission)
- Acknowledged in release notes
- Listed as security contributors in the project

Thank you for helping keep Codex Usage Tracker secure!
